## About

The cybersecurity process encompasses a wide array of strategies and practices aimed at protecting information systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.

This article highlights the integration of DevSecOps, application security programs, Architecture security enhancements, basic and advanced security, deployment operations, and the alignment of people, processes and technology.

---

## Process Overview

The Cybersecurity workstream process consists of the following steps:

1. DevSecOps: Integrating security practices within the DevOps process to ensure continuous security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC);
2. Application Security Programs: Implementing security measures and best practices to protect applications from vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle;
3. Security Education and Training (for developers, operation engineers, solution architects etc.);
4. Security by Design (at infrastructure, platform and application level);
5. Deployment Operations: Ensuring secure deployment processes to prevent unauthorized access and maintain system integrity;
6. Continuous Security Automation Scanning and Testing in all the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps from Code to Cloud);
7. Continuous Runtime Protection (Cloud, Clusters, Containers, Code).

## Key Steps

- Establish the Application Security Framework and Program
- Define and Document Security Architecture
- Develop and Enable Cybersecurity Resources
- Establish Robust Security Governance
- Provide Security Training and Awareness
- Implement Secure Coding Practices
- Adopt DevSecOps methodology into the SDLC
- Integrate Software Composition Analysis
- Incorporate Secrets Scanning
- Incorporate Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Perform Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

---

## Objectives

- Invest in Cybersecurity expertise (People) and accelerate the implementation of DevSecOps best practices (Process)
- Embrace a Cloud Native Application Security Program
- Ensure Compliance by adhering to regulatory requirements and internal governance standards.
- Foster a Security Culture by promoting security awareness and best practices.
- Shift left Security by embedding cybersecurity practices within the SDLC through DevSecOps.
- Protect Digital Solutions by securing the applications at every stage, from development to deployment.

---

## Methodology

- Risk Management Frameworks: Utilize frameworks like NIST RMF, NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO 27001 to guide security practices.
- Cloud-Native Security: Security built into the application and infrastructure from the ground up
- DevSecOps: Integrate security processes and tooling into engineering workflows and supporting technology stacks
- Security Awareness Programs: Educate employees on cybersecurity threats and safe practices.
- Governance and Compliance Audits: Perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with regulations and standards.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the cybersecurity workstream is to protect Ministry of Health (MOH) Indonesia’s digital assets from threats and vulnerabilities. This involves ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. Enable both solution developers (BADR) and UNDP Indonesia on the rapidly evolving development and deployment environments. Embrace a Cloud Native Application Security Program.

---

## Scope

- **People and Process**: Conduct application security training and promote continuous security awareness to foster secure design principles
- **Architecture Security**: Ensure sound, secure architecture design with proper security controls and protections. Leverage threat modelling techniques to identify weaknesses and proactively mitigate them.
- **Application Security**: Implementing security measures throughout the software development lifecycle to protect applications from threats. Utilize secure configuration and hardening techniques, verify deployments, and employ automated deployment pipelines.
- **Basic Security**: Integrating application security testing (AST), software composition analysis and secure coding practice into CI/CD Pipeline
- **Advanced Security**: Integrate Web application and API protection, Mobile application security, runtime application protection (security monitoring detection and response)
